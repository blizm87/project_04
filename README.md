### Approach

After completing the mini agile sprint before this project, as a group we knew 
that we needed to spend more time on the planning process this time around. We
spent most of Day 1 whiteboarding different app ideas, writing out our CRUD
operations, wireframing, etc. and decided on the most flushed out idea that we had. 

Once we had our project idea, we split up roles/tasks, and wanted to make sure to 
specify which features team members/pairs would be responsible for from front to back. 
We also tried our best to modularize our functions in order to avoid multiple team 
members working on the same files, and worked off of separate branches and kept the 
master branch clean. We whiteboarded our to-dos at the start of each day and divided 
them up, and checked them off as they were completed. 

### Obstacles

There were certain features that ended up being more complicated to code than we
had originally thought. Having standups every morning and evening helped us to 
reprioritize which features we wanted to spend time on and which to mark as optional. 

On the morning of Day 4, we faced a ton of merge conflicts and had to resolve all
the conflicts before we were able to move on. This was probably the biggest obstacle
we faced during this process. We always made sure to resolve conflicts in pairs and
not individually.
